sorting
======================
small| 8 numbers|19 comparisons
medium| 32 numbers|191 comparisons
large| 128 numbers|1471 comparisons

The smallest size has **8** numbers
The largest size has **128** numbers
The medium size has **32** numbers

This sort method is better than bubble sort because the runtime of bubble sort is n^2.

However, when we increase the size of the array, the runtime grows faster because there are more comparisons.
